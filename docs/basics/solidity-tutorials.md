# Basics

## What is Solidity?

a programming language for writing smart contracts and tell them how to behave.

so what happens is this solidity codes is converted into bytecode and then it is deployed on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

## What we can build with solidity?

- DApps
- DAOs
- NFTs
- DeFi
- Crypto Coins (like USDC, USDT, etc)

### **DApps (Decentralized Applications)**

DApps are applications built on blockchain networks that operate without centralized control. They leverage smart contracts to automate processes, ensuring transparency and trust. Examples include Uniswap (for decentralized trading) and Aave (for lending/borrowing).

### **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**

DAOs are blockchain-based organizations governed by smart contracts and member voting. Members hold governance tokens, which allow them to propose and vote on decisions like budget allocation or protocol changes. Examples include MakerDAO and Aragon.

### **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**

NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership of items like art, music, or virtual real estate. Built on standards like ERC-721 or ERC-1155, NFTs enable provable scarcity and ownership transfer on the blockchain. Examples include CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club.

### **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**

DeFi platforms replicate traditional financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading but operate without intermediaries. Smart contracts automate these services, often using protocols like Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Examples include Compound and Yearn Finance.

### **Crypto Coins (like USDC, USDT, etc)**

Crypto coins are digital currencies issued on a blockchain. Some represent stable value (like USDC or USDT, pegged to fiat currencies) or are native to blockchains (like ETH or MATIC). They serve as a medium of exchange, store of value, or utility within ecosystems.
